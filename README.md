# ant-colony-simulator
Object-oriented Java simulation demonstrating modular backend design, inheritance hierarchies, and event-driven system logic.

This project simulates an ant colony defending against invading bees using an event-driven architecture. Built entirely in Java, it emphasizes inheritance, encapsulation, and modular design patterns common in modern backend systems.

# Core Features
- Modular agent system with ants and bees as autonomous objects  
- Event-driven game loop controlling state and actions per turn  
- Abstract base classes for flexible behavior extension  
- Clear separation between model, logic, and control layers

  ###  Technical Highlights
- Implemented complex inheritance hierarchies (Ant, Bee, Insect)
- Designed clean APIs between simulation components
- Practiced defensive programming and state management
- Applied backend architecture principles in a game environment
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance & Polymorphism
- Event-Driven Simulation
- System Design & Architecture
